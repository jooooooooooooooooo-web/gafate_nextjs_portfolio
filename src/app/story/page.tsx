                I was always interested in technology. My dad was a mecahnical engineer, so he would tinker with cars and small 
                devices all around the house. I remember my first time trying it out for myself was opening up an old game console
                in order to get all the dust out. At first, I wanted to follow what my dad did and purse mechanical engineering, but
                he told me that in the future, the money would be in computers. Computer Engineering seemed attractive, but I just
                did not have the temperament for the mathematics side of it all. A Computer Science class I got the chance tot take
                in high school showed me how fun the software side of things could be. From there, I could see a balance of passion
                and money.

                There was, however, another side to my history. In grade school, I won accolades for my essays in grades 2 and 5.
                My work with writing was praised all through high school. In my early years of college, my writing was so strong that
                my professor asked if I was an English major. I did not pay it much attention, but looking back on it, my mind may
                have been better suited for creative work. At first, I brushed it off, telling myself that there is no profit in
                such work. Even later, I regretted my path, thinking I would have been happier pursing this kind of career. Now,
                I understand that it is still an important side to myself, one that I can incorporate into my career with computers.
                I realized that both peers and mentors worked to bridge the gap between logic and creativity. Knowing that I was not
                alone in this thinking led me to express myself in my technology, while also keeping my creative mind active on the side.

            <p className="text-black text-[18px] text-base leading-7">
                Although I wanted to combine the ability to do both physical work and development, I found that I did not have many
                examples of it being done. It was difficult to wrap my head around doing both types of work. When I returned to school,
                I had some work experience in the space of Information Technology, but it seemed at odds with the skills in Computer
                Science I was learning. I was getting ready to give up when I happened upon some online forums, in a spur of the moment
                look around the internet. I discovered the term "DevOps", along with the simiple description that it was essentially
                doing IT and Software Development at the same time. I couldn't believe it at first, the two concepts seemed so at odds
                with each other. However, the more I read, the more I realized that it could be done. I found my most passionate skills
                to be in building computers and maintining networks. While I was good at programming, I lacked a certain amount of passion
                for the work. DevOps provided me the middle ground that I was so desperately looking for. Just like how my creativity
                seemed at odds with my logic, I discovered a way to blend the mental and the physical.

                I know what I want now, and I know that it is no mere pipe dream. There will always be room for technological experts,
                the the possibilities only grow in the role of DevOps. When I was first training in IT, one of my menotrs pointed out
                that he was never satisfied in one role, and that he was always looking to learn a new skill. It brought to my mind
                and old saying, "A jack of all trades is a master of none." However, I always thought that was folly. Shouldn't a person
                focus on one skill to be the best at, so that no job will deny them. But the saying continues, "but oftentimes better 
                than a master of one." Maybe it is possible that one of my skills will not be enough to land a job specializing in that
                skill. However, when I know everything, there is a place for me everywhere. And if I really aim to know everything, I
                need to be able to accept knew concepts. The framework of technology is always changing, meaning a Jack of All Trades
                never stops learning.
